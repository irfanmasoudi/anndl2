# Time-series classification

## Dataset structure
We are given a multivariate dataset that consists of 7 ordered features. We have 68528 data points for each feature. Here is an overview of the 7 ordered features of the data frame:

We have tried 2 scenarios: 

a) Divide the dataset into train and test.
 
b) Feed all examples into the training process and do validation. When we tried to implement the second scenario into a simple model, we got much better results. So for the next experiment, we constantly used all datasets for the training process in the model selection.

We first had to be careful that the dataset was clean and preprocessed. That means no wrong or NaN values or significant time gaps in the data. ANNs look at the numerical value of the input so after we normalized all training inputs to be within the same range.

## Model Selection

Being a multivariate time series forecasting problem, we have to provide a prediction for each time step in the test prediction window. The networks we have implemented mostly used the Mean Average Error (MAE) as a metrics. The metric used to evaluate models and place the Teams in Leaderboard on Codalab is the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### Unchanged value of Window, Stride, and Telescope.
In this section, we have implemented a couple of different model scenarios. We always keep the window equal to 200, stride equal 20, and telescope with 50.

| 2.  Model with window=200, stride=10 and telescope=100 | 9.1587381363  |
| 3.  Model with window=600, stride=2 and telescope=864  | 4.7141537666  |

### Early Stopping and Reduce Learning Rate

We implement early stopping to tackle the overfitting problem, even though we have implemented Dropout in our model. 

```
EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', 
mode='min',
patience=10,
restore_best_weights=True)
```

The goal is to stop the training when the validation error starts increasing. When our training is going to plateau, we reduce the learning rate, 

```
ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss',
mode='min', 
patience=5, 
factor=0.5,
min_lr=1e-5).
```

### Conclusion

After first inspecting the structure of our time series dataset and deciding to use all data for the training process and validation, we tested different model architectures. In the first step of model selection, various models were tested with fixed and unchanged window, stride and telescope values. Based on the result we had on Codalab, we kept the model architecture with the lowest RMSE value, the Bidirectional LSTM with 2 layers with an RMSE value of 11.5225048065.

In the second step of model selection, we modified the hyperparameter values of the model architecture selected in the first step. The best result we managed to get is 4.0347905159 with a 2-layer bidirectional LSTM model with window=600, stride 1, and telescope=864. Thatâ€™s why we chose it as our best model.
